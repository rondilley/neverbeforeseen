=== Never Before Seen (NBS)

== What is nbs?

nbs (Never before seen) is a redux of NBS from MJR and
it processes arbitrary text data, remembers what it has
previosuly seen, and only shows new text data.

== Why use it?

I remade nbs because NBS could not compile on a current
version of Ubuntu and it was quicker to rebuild the tool
to meet my needs than to reverse engineer Marcus' code
and port it.


== Implimentation


== Compatibility

I have built and tested nbs on the following operating systems:

* XXX

I have confirmed that dt does not compile or run on the following:

* XXX

== Security Implications

Assume that there are errors in the dt source that would
allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to your
computer.  Don't trust this software and install and use
it at your own risk.

== Bugs

I am not a programmer by any strech of the imagination.  I
have attempted to remove the obvious bugs and other
programmer related errors but please keep in mind the first
sentence.  If you find an issue with code, please send me
an e-mail with details and I will be happy to look into
it.
